# 💬 GoMessenger, a Real-Time Chat Backend in Go

The GoMessenger is a **real-time chat platform** built with **Go**, designed to explore advanced backend engineering concepts — including caching, messaging, rate limiting, observability, end-to-end testing, and NoSQL databases.

## 🧠 Core Services

### 🔹 **Gateway Service**

- Client endpoint service.
- Handles WebSocket connections.
- Applies **rate limiting** per user.
- Publishes messages to the message queue.

### 🔹 **Authentication Service**

- Authenticates users via JWT and stores sessions in Redis.
- Persist all users in NOSQL Database (Mongo)

### 🔹 **Chat Service**

- Consumes messages from the queue.
- Persists messages in the NoSQL database (Mongo)
- Publishes new message events through Redis Pub/Sub.
- Ensures idempotent delivery.

### 🔹 **Presence Service** WIP

- Tracks online/offline user status using Redis.
- Publishes presence updates to gateways.

### 🔹 **Notification Service** WIP

- Processes asynchronous events from the queue.
- Sends external notifications (push, email, or simulated logs).

## ⚙️ Message Flow

1. A user connects via WebSocket → authenticated via JWT.
2. Session stored in Redis.
3. User sends a message → published to the message queue (`chat.message.created`).
4. Chat Service consumes, stores in MongoDB, and publishes via Redis Pub/Sub.
5. Presence Service updates online/offline status.
6. Observability tools track message latency and throughput.

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes

✅ Real-time communication with WebSocket
✅ Distributed cache and Pub/Sub (Redis)
✅ Asynchronous messaging (Redis Streams/RabbitMQ/NATS/SQS)
WIP: Rate limiting and connection control
WIP: Full observability (logs, metrics, tracing)
WIP: End-to-end integration testing 
✅ Event-driven microservice architecture
